  ## Who is Ola?

  Ola Akinpelu is a business-forward problem solver, who uses statistical modeling and predictive analytics to solve business challenges.
content: >
  #### I create value for companies by understanding the financial cost of problems 
  and delivering a return-on-investment with data solutions. 
  
  I design and build visually appealing and informative web applications, reports, 
  and dashboards that facilitate strategic decision-making.
  
  Outside of my professional role, I am deeply passionate about community and 
  giving back to society. Volunteering at local schools(nonprofit) and participating 
  in teaching mathematics and statistics aimed at making a positive impact on the community. 
  This brings me immense fulfillment.
